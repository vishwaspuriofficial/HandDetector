# HandDetector
A program that detects the 22 unique points on your hand on a live stream camera!

It uses mediapipe (by Google) and its pretrained models with a data set of thousands of hand photos to determine the unique 22 points in our hands.

This program is made using python supported by streamlit.

This program could be used to make many innovative projects that require hand detection and/or hand motion tracking.
